## SBSLMM
"SBSLMM" refering to 
standing for Transcriptome-Intergrated Genetic Association Resource, which is developed using Python and BASH scripts. TIGAR can fit both Elastic-Net and nonparametric Beyesian model (Dirichlet Process Regression, i.e. DPR) for gene expression imputation, impute genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) from individual-level genotype data, and conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) using both individual-level and summary-level GWAS data for univariate and multivariate phenotypes.
